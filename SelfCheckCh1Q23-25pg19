23.  Consider the following pseudocode for finding the most attractive photo from a sequence of photos:
Pick the first photo and call it "the best so far". 
For each photo in the sequence   
  If it is more attractive than the "best so far"   
    Discard "the best so far".    
    Call this photo "the best so far".
    
The photo called "the best so far" is the most attractive photo in the sequence. Is this an algorithm that will find the most attractive photo?

      Answer: Yes!


24.  Suppose each photo in Self Check 23 had a price tag. Give an algorithm for finding the most expensive photo.

  Anwer: 
    Pick the first photo and call it "The most expensive so far"
      if it is the most expensive  than the "The most expensive so far"
        Discard "the most expnesive so far"
          then Call this photo "The most expensive so far"
          
25. Suppose you have a random sequence of black and white marbles and want to rearrange it so that the black and white marbles are grouped together. Consider this algorithm: 
 Repeat until sorted   
  Locate the first black marble that is preceded by a white marble, and switch them. 
  
     What does the algorithm do with the sequence Marbles-->(white, black, white, black, black)? Spell out the steps until the algorithm        stops.
     
     Answer: 
             Marbles-->(white, black, white, black, black)  
     Repeat until sorted   
      Locate the first black marble that is preceded by a white marble, and switch them
        Marbles-->(black,white, white, black, black) 
        Marbles-->(black,white, black, white, black)
         Marbles-->(black, black, white, white, black)
        Marbles-->(black, black, white, white, black) 
          Marbles-->(black, black, white, white) 
          Marbles-->(black, black, white, black, white) 
            Marbles-->(black, black, black, white, white) 
            break;
            out the loop
